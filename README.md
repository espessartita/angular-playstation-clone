# PS Store Clone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## About

Old Play Station Store clone for [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) Bootcamp. Studies on Angular and component creation.

### TODO

Some things I want to improve in the future:
- [ ] Improve general appearance;
- [ ] New card animations (goal: game label and price stop glitching over bigger game image on hover);
- [ ] Footer;
- [ ] Maybe a drop down menu like the new PSStore;
<br/>
(More might be added to this list in the future)
